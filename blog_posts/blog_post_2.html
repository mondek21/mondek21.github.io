          <h2>French Canyon</h2>
          <h3>By:  Michael Ondek</h3>
          <p>
            French Canyon is the furthest canyon while traveling west from Parkman's Plain without crossing Route 71.  This
            canyon is most easily accessed from The Lodge parking lot, but when hiking from the Parkman's Plain parking lot,
            like I did, it makes quite a journey.  The path requires travel on both the River Trail and the Bluffs Trail.
            Unfortunately, because of the proximity to the Lodge, this Canyon is heavily traveled and can get congested.  Even
            so, this is one of the most fun hikes to the waterfall because there is no gravel path or boardwalk available.
            The waterfall can only be reached by walking up rock steps, which when the water is high, are covered with running
            water.
