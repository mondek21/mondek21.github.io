          <h2>Lasalle Canyon</h2>
          <h3>By:  Michael Ondek</h3>
          <p>
            Lasalle Canyon is the closest large waterfall to the Parkman's Plain parking lot.  This lot has been improved
            and is much larger than it has been in the past.  The initial walk from Parkman's Plain parking lot has a large
            change in elevation that includes gravel path, wooden stairs with rails, and stairs with no rails that are made with
            wood and gravel.  This elevation change is important to remember when going on long hikes, because you are going down
            when you are leaving the lot, <u>which means your walk will end with a lot of climbing</u>.
