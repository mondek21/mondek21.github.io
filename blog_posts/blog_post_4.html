          <h2>Tonty Canyon</h2>
          <h3>By:  Michael Ondek</h3>
          <p>
            Tonty Canyon is "temporarily closed" right now due to water eroding the trail.  This closure has been long lasting
            and there is no immediate plan for the trail to be improved.  Normally Tonty Canyon would be accessible from two
            different paths.  The first access point is directly from Lasalle Canyon and the second access point is from the
            River Trail.  Here is a quote from the Illinois Department of Natural Resources website regarding trail safety
            and navigation:
          </p>
          <blockquote cite="https://www2.illinois.gov/dnr/Parks/Activity/Pages/StarvedRock.aspx">
            The trails are open all year, but hikers are urged to <u>exercise extreme caution and to stay on official trails</u>.
            To keep you oriented, trail maps are located at all trail access points, intersections and points of interest.
            There are colored posts along the trails, corresponding to colors on the maps, and letter symbols on the trail
            brochure to further assist you. Finally, yellow dots on posts indicate that you are moving away from the lodge or
            visitor center, and white dots mean you are returning.
