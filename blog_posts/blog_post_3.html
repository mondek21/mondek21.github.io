          <h2>Wildcat Canyon</h2>
          <h3>By:  Mike Ondek</h3>
          <p>
            Wildcat Canyon is an enjoyable path to hike.  A bright point along the path for me was along the final approach
            to the waterfall.  The path crosses the stream that flows through the canyon and there is no bridge, only logs and
            rocks to help prevent your feet from being soaked. After I had walked sideways the length of a log, balancing along
            the way as the log rolled forwards and backwards slightly, I stepped towards a stump.  Before I landed on the stump
            I noticed <i>a snake in the water within inches of the stump</i>.  Being startled as I was by the snake I jumped away from
            it, soaking my shoes and socks.  Upon closer inspection I could see it was a small water moccasin, and I was glad
            I stayed clear.
