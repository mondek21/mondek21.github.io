          <h2>Tonty Canyon</h2>
          <h3>By:  Mike Ondek</h3>
          <p>
            Tonty Canyon is "temporarily closed" right now due to water eroding the trail.  This closure has been long lasting
            and there is no immediate plan for the trail to be improved.  Normally Tonty Canyon would be accessible from two
            different paths.  The first access point is directly from Lasalle Canyon and the second access point is from the
            River Trail.
